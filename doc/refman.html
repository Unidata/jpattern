<h2><u><a name="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></a></u></h2>

Most current programming languages provide some form of
pattern matching. As a rule, the pattern matching is
based on regular expressions. The Comit/Snobol3/Snobol4/Spitbol
programming languages have provided pattern matching but
based on a pattern matching paradigm that is strictly more
powerful than standard regular expressions.
<p>
The goal of this project is to make Snobol4-style pattern matching
available as a package for the Java programming language.
Rather than build such a package from scratch,
Rober Dewar's
existing
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.3.6/gnat_rm/The-GNAT-Library.html#The-GNAT-Library">Ada-based Gnat Spitbol Patterns code</a>
was converted to Java.
The result is generally consistent with that Ada package, although
some changes were made to conform to the capabilities and
limitations of the Java language. In light of the derived nature of this code,
the original GNAT license is assumed to cover this code.
The compiler, however is licensed under a BSD license.
See the <a target="_self" href="#License">License Section</a>
for more details.

<h2><u><a name="Tutorial"><b>Pattern Matching Tutorial</b></a></u></h2>
The following introduction is taken from the file G-SPIPAT.ADS.
It has been modified to conform to the Java version for various
details.

<h3><u><a name="API">API Overview</a></u></h3>
The API deliberately bears more than a passing resemblance
to the <i>java.util.regex</i> structure.
The major classes are
<i>jpattern.Pattern</i>,
<i>jpattern.Matcher</i>
and <i>jpattern.MatchResult</i> (which is a java interface).
<p>
<h4><u><a name="Pattern">Pattern Functions</a></u></h4>
Pattern class instances are constructed using a set of
functions defined in the class <i>jpattern.Pattern</i>.
These pattern functions take one of three kinds of argument types.
<ol>
<li> <i>java.lang.string</i>. This represents a simple string. In some cases,
a string of length one will be treated as a single character.
<p>
<li> <i>jpattern.Pattern</i>. This represents a sub-pattern.
<p>
<li> <i>jpattern.Variable</i>. This represents a name that will be interpreted
later to refer to a value in a map. See
<a target="_self" href="#Variables">Variables</a>
for more details.
</ol>
The specific pattern construction operators are as follows.<p>
<table>
<tr><td>Cancel() <td> Concat(Pattern, Pattern) <td> Rem()
<tr><td>Abort() <td> Defer(Variable) <td> Rest()
<tr><td>Alternate(Pattern, Pattern) <td> Fail() <td> RPos(int)
<tr><td>Any(String) <td> Fence() <td> RPos(Variable)
<tr><td>Any(Variable) <td> Fence(Pattern) <td> RTab(int)
<tr><td>Arb() <td> IAssign(Pattern, Variable) <td> RTab(Variable)
<tr><td>Arbno(String P) <td> Java(Object) <td> Setcur(Variable)
<tr><td>Arbno(Pattern) <td> Len(int) <td> Span(String)
<tr><td>Assign(Pattern, Variable) <td> Len(Variable) <td> Span(Variable)
<tr><td>Bal() <td> NotAny(String) <td> Succeed()
<tr><td>Bal(String) <td> NotAny(Variable) <td> Tab(int)
<tr><td>Bal(Variable) <td> NSpan(String) <td> Tab(Variable)
<tr><td>Break(String) <td> NSpan(Variable) <td> StringPattern(String)
<tr><td>Break(Variable) <td> Pos(int) <td> CharPattern(char)
<tr><td>BreakX(String) <td> Pos(Variable) <td> External(String,Object...)
<tr><td>BreakX(Variable) <td> Replace(Pattern, Variable)
</table>
<p>
All of these methods are <i>static public</i>
and all of them throw the exception <i>jpattern.Error</i>.
<p>
Consider the following pattern.
<blockquote><pre>
("abc" | "ab") & ("de" | "cd")
</pre></blockquote>
This pattern could be construct using the following sequence of
Pattern functions.
<p>
<code>
Pattern pe1 = Pattern.Alt("abc","ab");<br>
Pattern pe2 = Pattern.Alt("de","cd");<br>
Pattern pe3 = Pattern.Concat(pe1,pe2);
</code>

<h4><u><a name="Matching">Matching</a></u></h4>
As with <i>java.util.regex.Pattern</i>
an instance of
<i>jpattern.Matcher</i>
is created by calling a factory method of the
<i>jpattern.Pattern</i>
class.
This method has several signatures.
<pre>
    public Matcher matcher();
    public Matcher matcher(String subject);
    public Matcher matcher(String subject, VarMap vars);
    public Matcher matcher(String subject, VarMap vars, ExternalMap externs);
</pre><p>
The meaning of the VarMap and ExternalMap arguments are explained
elsewhere in this document.
<p>
The class
<i>jpattern.Matcher</i>
implements the following relevant methods
<pre>
    public boolean match() throws Error;
    public boolean match(String subject, VarMap vars, ExternalMap externs)
        throws Error;

    public Matcher setAnchorMode(boolean b);
    public Matcher setStackSize(int n) throws Error;
    public Matcher setSubject(String newsubject);
    public Matcher reset(String newsubject); // alias for setSubject
    public Matcher setVarMap(VarMap map);
    public Matcher setExternalMap(ExternalMap map);
</pre><p>
The first
<i>match()</i>
assumes that the various parameters of the match have already been set,
either by the call to <i>Pattern.matcher()</i>
or by invocation of the various parameter setting methods such as
<i>setSubject()</i>.
<p>
The <i>jpattern.MatchResult</i> interface
- like its <i>java.util.regex.MatchResult</i> analog -
provides a means for returning three values from
the match if the match succeeds.
It is an interface defined as follows.
<pre>
public interface MatchResult {
    public String getSubject();
    public int getStart();
    public int getStop();
}
</pre><p>
The meaning of the methods is as follows.
<ul>
<li> getStart: the starting cursor index of the location in the Subject string where the successful match started.
<li> getStop: the cursor index of the location in the Subject string just past the last character where the successful match stopped.
<li> getSubject: the subject string after the successful match. Unless replacement
operators occur in the pattern, then this will be the same object
as the Subject argument to the <i>Match()</i> function.
</ul>
Note that the cursor indices are zero-based to be more useful with
Java strings. This differs
from the Snobol standard of one-based indices.
<p>
The 
<i>jpattern.Matcher</i> class implements the
<i>jpattern.MatchResult</i> interface,
so as a rule, the Matcher can be used to obtain
the match results.

<h4><u><a name="Variables">Variables</a></u></h4>
It is possible to use variables within patterns for a number of purposes.
A variable is represented as a string matching the following regular
expression: "[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*"
(Note that sometimes RE's are more compact).
<p>
As a rule, the variable name should be preceded by the defer operator
("+") or an assignment operator ("." "$" "*" "**") or
a replacement operator ("=").
The leading "+" is not required unless the variable name is also a keyword.
<p>
As a rule, any elementary
<a target="_self" href="#Available">pattern operator</a>
that takes an argument may have a variable as its argument.
<p>
During the match, if a reference to a variable is required, then
it searched for in the <i>VarMap</i> passed to the <i>jpattern.Matcher</i>.
The value associated with the variable in the map can be of the
following types
(but see also <a target="_self" href="#IDPM">here</a>).
<dl>
<dt>
<i>java.util.Collection</i>
</dt>
<dd>
If a java <i>Collection</i> is associated with the variable,
and the variable is being used as an immediate assignment
(e.g. "*x"), then the value assigned to the variable is appended
to the end of the collection. In conjunction with the <i>fail</i>
pattern, this can be used to collect all possible matches
of a pattern against a subject string.
</dd>
<dt>
<i>jpattern.ExternalVariable</i>
</dt>
<dd>
If the value associated with the variable in the map is of this type,
then the <i>get()</i> method is invoked for that object
when it is used as a value or as the source of a replace.
If the variable is being used as the target of an immediate or
deferred assignment then its <i>put()</i> method is invoked
to do something with the value. This would allow, for example,
a trace of a pattern match to be output to standard output.
See the discussion about
<a target="_self" href="#JavaComm">communication with Java</a>
for more details.

</dd>
<dt>
<i>java.lang.Object</i>
</dt>
<dd>
For this final case, the object is converted to a string
and that value is used either for replacement or for matching.
</dd>
</dl>
If the variable is not defined in the map, then if it is involved
in an assignment, it is inserted into the map. Otherwise, an
exception is thrown signalling an undefined variable.


<h4><u><a name="Grammar">Pattern Specification Language</a></u></h4>
The string representation of patterns uses the following BNF syntax.
<pre>
    pattern := alt;
    alt := cat | cat '|' alt;
    cat := replace | replace '&' cat | replace cat;
    replace := assign | assign '=' variable;
    assign :=   element
              | element '**' variable
              | element '.' variable
              | element '*' variable
              | element '$' variable;
    element := operator | '(' pattern ')' | defer | INT | STRING;
    operator := 
                | "+" variable
                | "abort" | cancel
                | "any" "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "arb" "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "arbno" "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "bal" | bal "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "break" "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "breakx" "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "fence" | fence "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "fail"
                | "len" "(" njvarg ")"
                | "notany", "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "nspan" "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "pos" "(" njvarg ")"
                | "rem" | "rest"
                | "rpos", "(" njvarg ")"
                | "rtab" "(" njvarg ")"
                | "setcur" "(" defer ")"
                | "span" "(" sjvarg ")"
                | "succeed"
                | "tab" "(" njvarg ")"
                ;
    sjvarg := STRING | JAVASTRING | defer;
    njvarg := INT | JAVASTRING | defer;
    defer := variable | "+" variable;

    variable := ID;

    # Lexical Elements
    ID := [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]* that is not a keyword.
    INT := [-]?[0-9]+ | "0x" [0-9a-fA-F]+
    STRING := '"' <escaped characters> '"'
    JAVASTRING := '`' <escaped characters> '`'
</pre><p>
Whitespace (" \t\n\r...") and comments may appear
in expressions where desired. The comments are either
the "//...\n" type or the "/*...*/" type.
Be careful to not put an end-of-line escape before any comments on that line.
That is, do not write
<pre>
@len(5) \ //comment 1
bal()@
</pre>
but rather write this.
<pre>
@len(5) //comment 1 \
bal()@
</pre>
<h3><u><a name="PatternOverview">Pattern Matching Overview</a></u></h3>
We will start with two basic functions: concatenation ("&amp;")
and alternation ("|").
If A and B are patterns, then
"A &amp; B" means try to match A,
and if that succeeds, then try to match B starting after A.
Note that the &amp; is actually optional, and the juxtiposition
of the two patterns is taken to imply concatenation.
Thus "A B" is the treated the same as "A &amp; B".
Note that this means you must be careful with whitespace
since, for example, <i>fence("a")</i> and <i>fence&nbsp;&nbsp;("a")</i>
mean two different things.
<p>
The expression
"A | B" means try to match A and if that fails,
then try to match B starting at the same place where the
attempt to match A began.
<p>
There is full backtracking, which means that if a given pattern
element fails to match, then previous alternatives are matched.
For example if we have the pattern:
<blockquote><pre>
(A | B) (C | D) (E | F)
</pre></blockquote>
First we attempt to match A, if that succeeds, then we go on to try
to match C, and if that succeeds, we go on to try to match E. If E
fails, then we try F. If F fails, then we go back and try matching
D instead of C. Let's make this explicit using a specific example,
and introducing the simplest kind of pattern element, which is a
literal string. The meaning of this pattern element is simply to
match the characters that correspond to the string characters. Now
let's rewrite the above pattern form with specific string literals
as the pattern elements:
<blockquote><pre>
("ABC" | "AB")("DEF" | "CDE")("GH" | "IJ")
</pre></blockquote>
The following strings will be attempted in sequence:
<ol>
<li> ABC . DEF . GH
<li> ABC . DEF . IJ
<li> ABC . CDE . GH
<li> ABC . CDE . IJ
<li> AB . DEF . GH
<li> AB . DEF . IJ
<li> AB . CDE . GH
<li> AB . CDE . IJ
</ol>
Here we use the dot simply to separate the pieces of the string
matched by the three separate elements.

<h4><u><a name="Moving">Moving the Start Point</a></u></h4>
A pattern is not required to match starting at the first character
of the string, and is not required to match to the end of the string.
The first attempt does indeed attempt to match starting at the first
character of the string, trying all the possible alternatives. But
if all alternatives fail, then the starting point of the match is
moved one character, and all possible alternatives are attempted at
the new anchor point.
<p>
The entire match fails only when every possible starting point has
been attempted. As an example, suppose that we had the subject
string
<blockquote><pre>
"ABABCDEIJKL"
</pre></blockquote>
matched using the pattern in the previous example:
<blockquote><pre>
("ABC" | "AB") &amp; ("DEF" | "CDE") &amp; ("GH" or "IJ")
</pre></blockquote>
This would succeed, after two anchor point moves:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
"ABABCDEIJKL"
   ^^^^^^^
</pre></blockquote>
where the "^^^^^^^" indicates the matched section.
<p>
This mode of pattern matching is called the unanchored mode. It is
also possible to put the pattern matcher into anchored mode by
calling the function <i>Match.setAnchorMode(true)</i>
This will cause
all subsequent matches to be performed in anchored mode, where the
match is required to start at the first character.
We will also see later how the effect of an anchored match can be
obtained for a single specified anchor point if this is desired.

<tr><td valign="top">Description:</td>
<td>
The Defer operator (+V) where V is a variable,
obtains at match time
a value for V from the VarMap argument to the Match function.
It then proceeds to match that value as if it had been present
in the original pattern at that point. The leading "+" is optional
unless the variable name matches a keyword.
See also the <a target="_self" href="#Variables">Variables</a> discussion.
<p>
A deferred pattern can be used to create a recursive pattern
that will, at pattern matching time, follow
the pointer to obtain the referenced pattern, and then match this
pattern.
Consider for example, the following Java code.
<blockquote><pre>
Pattern P
    = Pattern.Alternate("A",
                        Pattern.Concat("B",
                                       Pattern.Defer("P")));
VarMap vars = new VarMap();
vars.put("P",P);
</pre></blockquote>
By placing the pattern P into the map with the name P (the name can be
anything consistent), we cause P to recurse through the map.
The <a target="_self" href="#Examples">Examples</a> section
provides illustrations of recursive patterns.
<p>
On the first attempt to match, this pattern attempts to match the string "A".
If this fails, then the alternative matches a "B", followed by an
attempt to match the value of "P", which is of source the Pattern P.
This second attempt now first attempts to
match "A", and so on. The result is a pattern that will match a
string of B's followed by a single A.
<p>
This particular example could simply be written
as <i>nspan("B") &amp; "A"</i>,
but the use of recursive patterns in the general case can construct
complex patterns which could not otherwise be built.

<h3<u><a name="Assignment">Pattern Assignment Operations</a></u></h3>
In addition to the overall result of a pattern match, which indicates
success or failure, it is often useful to be able to keep track of

pattern elements, or subsections of the pattern.

Deferred replacement is similar to deferred assignment.
With assignment, a variable is associated with a pattern and
when matching completes, the substring matched by that pattern
is assigned to the variable.

With deferred replacement, after a successful match,
the substring matched by the pattern is replaced by
the value of the variable (at the end of matching).

In order to access the modified subject string, the MatchResult
argument must used.

<h3><u><a name="IO">Input and Output</a></u></h3>
Jpattern supports the special variable "OUTPUT"
and "INPUT". Assigning to OUTPUT will cause the value
to be printed to standard output.
Referencing the variable INPUT will cause a line of input
to be read from standard input.
In addition, the variable "ERROROUTPUT" is defined
to write to standard error. The following aliases also
exist: "Output", "Input", "Erroroutput".
<p>
These special variables are not created unless Matcher.setIO(...)
is called.
<p>
The special variables are implemented by using the ExternalVariable
mechanism (see below).

<h2><u><a name="JavaComm">Interacting with Java</a></u></h2>
It can be desirable for a pattern to interact with the surrounding
Java code, and some (new) mechanisms are provided for that purpose.
<p>
It should be realized that the interaction can occur at two
different points in the lifetime of a pattern. First, interaction
can occur when a pattern is constructed using the
<a target="_self" href="#Compiler">the JPattern Pseudo-Compiler</a>.
Second, interaction can occur when the pattern is used to match a string.
<p>
<b><a name="IDPC">Interaction During Pattern Construction</a></b><br>
Java expressions may be passed through the compilation process
by enclosing them in backquotes ('`'): `5 + 6`, for example.
Several test cases - including 1, 3a3 and 5 -
demonstrate this.  Be careful when using this
mechanism because no type checking is performed, so you can cause
type errors when compiling the resulting Java code.
<p>
If the java expression in backquotes occurs in a position that requires it
to be a pattern object, then the expression is passed through a function
called <i>Pattern.Java()</i>.  This function forces the value of
the expression to be converted to a Pattern object. This is shown in
test case 5.
<p>
<b><a name="IDPM">Interaction During Pattern Matching</a></b><br>
Ideally, it should be possible to refer to Java variables
during pattern matching. Unfortunately, this would require the
use of reflection, which is cumbersome and relatively slow.
This is why the
<a target="_self" href="#Variables">Variable</a>
mechanism is provided instead.
<p>
<b>ExternalVariable:</b>
Another mechanism, the <i>ExternalVariable</i> mechanism,
is provided that can give some of the
benefits of access to surrounding Java.
Consider the following example (taken from test case 5a).
<pre>
class AccessJava implements ExternalVariable {
...
    Object current = null;
...
    public Object get(VarMap vars) {return current;}
    public void put(VarMap vars, Object val) {current = val;}
...
}
...
class Test5 extends Test {
...
    AccessJava func;
...
    func=new AccessJava();};
...
    vars.put("AccessJava",func);
    Pattern p = @("before" & span(" ")) $ +AccessJava & "after" = +AccessJava@;
}
</pre><p>
The AccessJava class implements the <i>jpattern.ExternalVariable</i> interface.
This interface provides a method called <i>get()</i>
and a method called <i>put()</i>.
is evaluated by the matcher whenever a variable of type <i>ExternalFunction</i>
is encountered.
In this case, AccessJava just returns the value of its parent's
<i>javaVariable1</i>
instance variable.
Since this is evaluated at match time, it provides a usable mechanism for
accessing Java variables and code at that time.
<p>
The AccessJava function is used by storing an instance of it under some name
("AccessJava" in this case) in the variable map that will be passed
to the <i>Match.match()</i> method.  In the code above, the
variable AccessJava is referenced at the end of the pattern, so during match
it will invoke the <i>AccessJava.get()</i> method as the last part of the
match. Of course, the reference could be any where as long as there
is no type conflict.
<p>
<b>ExternalPattern:</b>
The <i>ExternalPattern</i> mechanism
allows users of jpattern to define their own pattern operations.
<p>
Let us define a new external pattern called <i>RE(&lt;regular expression&gt;)</i>,
where the <i>&lt;regular expression&gt;</i> is a string in quotes that represents
a regular expression as defined by <i>java.util.regex.Pattern</i>.
<p>
This semantics of this user-defined pattern
are that it attempts to repeatedly match the regular expression
- call it RE -
against the  subject at the current cursor.  Thus, it is roughly similar to the
altered regular expression "RE+", which of course would be a legal
RE for this pattern and would negate the need for the implicit plus.
But the point here is to demonstrate how to use the ExternalPattern mechanism.
<p>
The basic process is to
define two classes: one that implements the <i>ExternalPattern</i>
interface and one that subclasses the <i>ExternalMatcher</i> class.
The latter can be an inner, final class within the first.
<p>
So, for the RE pattern, we define the following outline structure
(error checking and such have been elided).
<pre>
class REPattern implements ExternalPattern
{
    // The ExternalPattern interface requires three methods
    // getName, getNargs, and matcher.

    public String getName() {return "RE";}
    public int getNargs() {return 1;}

    public ExternalMatcher matcher(Object[] argv) throws Error
    {
        java.util.regex.Pattern jpat = null;
        jpat = java.util.regex.Pattern.compile((String)argv[0]);
        ExternalMatcher rem = new REMatcher(jpat);
        return rem;
    }
}
</pre><p>
The <i>matcher()</i> method is basically a factory method
for creating <i>ExternalMatcher</i> instances.
The reason for this is because the ExternalPattern instances
are shared by all occurrences in a compiled pattern.
So for each actual match of that pattern we must keep
a separate piece of state to track the match.
<p>
The corresponding <i>ExternalMatcher</i>
for <i>REPattern</i>
is <i>REMatcher</i>
and is defined as follows (again with elision).
<pre>
    final class REMatcher extends ExternalMatcher
    {
        // The only relevant state is the regular expression
        java.util.regex.Pattern regexp = null;

        public REMatcher(java.util.regex.Pattern jpat) {regexp = jpat;}

        public boolean initial() throws Error {...}
    
        public boolean retry() throws Error {...}

        public void fail() {jpat = null; ...}
    }
</pre><p>
On initial match attempt, the <i>initial()</i> method is called.
It returns true or false if the initial match succeeds or fails.
When the match backtracks into this operation,
the <i>retry()</i> method is called.
It returns true or false if the match retry succeeds or fails.
If it fails, then the <i>fail()</i> method is invoked to allow
the external pattern to reclaim any allocated resources.
<p>
This external pattern is defined by something like this.
<pre>
    ExternalMap externs = new ExternalMap();
    externs.add(new REPattern());
</pre><p>
Assume the invocation of the RE pattern looks something like this.
<pre>
    RE("[a][b]")
</pre><p>
The argument string <i>"[a][b]"</i> specifies the regular expression to match.
When the matcher encounters this pattern it invokes
<i>REPattern.matcher(&lt;regular expression string&gt;)</i>
to obtain the <i>REMatcher</i> instance.
<p>
The class <i>ExternalMatcher</i>
provides access to a set of fields that
provide access to the current state of the overall match.
The relevant definition is as follows.
<pre>
abstract public class ExternalMatcher {
    ...
    public String Subject;
    public VarMap Vars;
    public ExternalMap Externs;
    public int Anchor;
    public int Cursor;
    public boolean Cancel;
}
</pre><p>
The meaning of the fields is as follows.
<li> Subject: the subject string being used in the match.
<li> Vars: the variable map being used in the match.
<li> Externs: the external pattern map being used in the match.
<li> Anchor: the cursor index as it was at the beginning of the
     call to the <i>initial()</i> method.
<li> Cursor: the current cursor index.
<li> Cancel: return true if the match should be completely cancelled.
</ol>
<p>
The complete <i>initial()</i>
method for <i>REMatcher</i> is defined as follows (again with elision).
<pre>
    // Try the initial match. We want the maximum match
    // starting at the current cursor location.
    public boolean initial() throws Error
    {
        // Get the substring to match (with some test reporting)
        int curse = super.Cursor;
        String target = super.Subject.substring(curse);
        java.util.regex.Matcher m = regexp.matcher(target);
        boolean sf = m.lookingAt(); // anchored RE match
        if(!sf) return false; // failed                 
        // set the new cursor
        super.Cursor = (curse+m.end());
        return true;
    }
</pre><p>
The complete <i>retry()</i> method is defined as follows.
<pre>
    public boolean retry() throws Error
    {
        // Get the substring to match
        int curse = super.Cursor;
        String target = Subject.substring(curse);
        java.util.regex.Matcher m = regexp.matcher(target);
        boolean sf = m.lookingAt(); // anchored RE match
        if(!sf) return false; // failed                 
        // set the new cursor
        super.Cursor = (curse+m.end());
        return true;
    }
</pre><p>
Test case 12 shows the example completely worked out and operational.

<h2><u><a name="Exceptions">Exception Handling</a></u></h2>
For historical reasons, jpattern signals failures using a single
exception class <code>Failure</code> that is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>. This means that methods have
no "throws" clauses; but the Failure exception can be caught
by client code if desired.

<h2><u><a name="Compiler">The JPattern Pseudo-Compiler</a></u></h2>
The package jpattern.compiler supports the
compilation of string expressions into equivalent Pattern
objects.
It is capable of converting a string representation of a pattern
to equivalent Java code (via a command line interface)
or
to a Pattern object at runtime (via an API).

<h3><u><a name="CompilerMain">jpattern.compiler.Main</a></u></h2>

<h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
<h4><u>Command Line Usage</u></h4>
There are two primary calling forms, exemplified by the following.
<ol>
<li><code>java -classpath jpattern.jar jpattern.compiler.Main<br>
-pat "arb &amp; len(5)=x" -subject "1234567" -var "x=xyz"</code>
<p>
<li><code>java -classpath  jpattern.jar jpattern.compiler.Main<br>
-tag "@" &lt; javacode.pat &gt; javacode.java</code>
<p>
</ol>
The first command line case performs an actual match. It compiles the "-pat"
argument and matches it against the "-subject" string.
It reports if the match succeeds, and if so, prints out
the final values of all variables and the final subject line
after replacement.
The example above, for example would report success
and that the final subject line was "xyz67" and the final value of x
was "xyz".
<p>
The second case reads lines from
standard input ("javacode.pat" in this case)
and writes them to
standard output ("javacode.java" in this case).
As each line is read, it is searched for paired occurrences of
the java tag string (the argument to the
-tag flag or -xmltag flag).  The text between the occurrences is assumed to be
a pattern expression. Multiple patterns per line is disallowed.
That expression is compiled to equivalent Java code to construct
the Pattern and is written to standard output in place of the tagged
text. Patterns may span multiple lines by ending each line with
a backslash character ("\").
<p>
As an alternative, it should be possible to invoke
the compiler directly using the following command form:
<code>java -jar jpattern.jar ...</code>
This is because the jar file has the appropriate manifest within it.
It should be noted, however, that java <code>-D</code> flags
cannot be used when using the <code>-jar</code> flag.
<p>
To see how the compiler works,
suppose the first example was run with the following input file.
<pre>
public class Test0
{
    static void  makePattern()
    {
        Pattern Lnum = @pos(0) (Digs ".") span(" ")@;
        Pattern Digs = @span("0123456789")@;
    }
}
</pre>
It would produce the following output file.
<pre>
public class Test0
{
    static void makePattern()
    {
        Pattern Lnum = Pattern.Concat(
            Pattern.Pos(0),
            Pattern.Concat(
                Pattern.Concat(
                    Pattern.Defer(Variable.create("Digs")),
                    Pattern.StringPattern(".")
                ),
                Pattern.Span(" ")
            )
        );
        Pattern Digs = Pattern.Span("0123456789");
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
You can examine the .pat files in the test
directory to see other examples.

<h4><u>API Usage</u></h4>
The compiler may be invoked within a Java program to dynamically
generate Patterns from pattern specifications.
The Java code fragment equivalent to the first command line above would be
as follows.
<pre>
// Instantiate the compiler and compile the desired pattern.
Compiler compiler = new Compiler();
Pattern p = compiler.compile("arb & len(5)=x");

// Now create a VarMap and get a matcher from pattern p.
VarMap vars = new VarMap();
Match matcher = p.matcher();

//Recast the matcher as a match result
MatchResult result = (MatchResult)matcher;

// Now perform the match and report the result
String subject = "1234567";
boolean ok = matcher.match(subject,vars);
stdout.print(ok?"succeed: "+result.getSubject():"fail.");
</pre>

<h2><u><a name="Examples">Examples of Pattern Matching</a></u></h2>
<b>Example 1.</b>
This shows a simple example of the use of pattern replacement to remove
a line number from the start of a string. We assume that the line
number has the form of a string of decimal digits followed by a
period, followed by one or more spaces.
The tag delimiter for pattern specifications is "@". We will occasionally
include the concatenation operator ("&amp;").
<pre>
Pattern Digs = @span("0123456789")@;
Pattern Lnum = @pos(0) &amp; (+Digs &amp; ".")=nil &amp; span(" ")@;
</pre><P>
<p>
Now to use this pattern we simply do a match with a replacement:
<pre>
VarMap vars = new VarMap(); vars.put("Digs",Digs); vars.put("nil","");
boolean ok = Lnum.matcher().match(Line, vars);
</pre><p>
which replaces the line number by the null string.
<p>
The style we use here - defining constant patterns and then using
them - is typical. It is possible to build up patterns dynamically,
but it is usually more efficient to build them in pieces in advance
using constant declarations. Note in particular that although it is
possible to construct a pattern directly as an argument for the
Match routine, it is much more efficient to preconstruct the pattern
as we did in this example.
<p>
<b>Example 2.</b>
Now let's look at the use of pattern assignment to break a
string into sections. Suppose that the input string has two
unsigned decimal integers, separated by spaces or a comma,
with spaces allowed anywhere. Then we can isolate the two
numbers with the following pattern:
<pre>
Pattern B = @nspan(" ")@;
Pattern N = @span("0123456789")@;
Pattern T = @nspan(" ") +N*Num1 span(" ,") +N*Num2@;
</pre><p>
<p>
The match operation
<pre>
T.matcher().match(" 124, 257  ")
</pre><p>
would assign the string 124 to Num1 and the string 257 to Num2.
<p>
<b>Example 3.</b>
Now let's see how more complex elements can be built from the
set of primitive elements. The following pattern matches strings
that have the syntax of Ada 95 based literals:
<pre>
VarMap vars = new VarMap();
vars.put("DecDigits","0123456789");
vars.put("HexDigits","0123456789abcdefABCDEF");

Pattern Digs = @span(+DecDigits)@;
Pattern UDigs = @+Digs arbno("_" +Digs")@;
Pattern Hdig = @span(+HexDigits)@;
Pattern UHdig = @+Hdig arbno("_" +Hdig)@;
Pattern Bnum = @+UDigs "#" +UHdig "#"@;
vars.put("Digs",Digs);
vars.put("UDigs",UDigs);
vars.put("Hdig",Hdigs);
vars.put("UHdig",UHdigs);
vars.put("Bnum",Bnum);
</pre><p>
A match against Bnum will now match the desired strings, e.g.
it will match "16#123_abc#", but not "a#b#". However, this pattern
is not quite complete, since it does not allow colons to replace
the pound signs. The following is more complete:
<pre>
Pattern Bchar = @any("#:")@;
vars.put("Bchar",Bchar);
Pattern Bnum = @+UDigs +Bchar +UHdig +Bchar@;
</pre><p>
But that is still not quite right, since it allows # and : to be
mixed, and they are supposed to be used consistently. We solve
this by using a deferred match.
<pre>
Pattern Bnum  = @+UDigs Bchar*Temp UHdig +Temp@;
</pre><p>
Here the first instance of the base character is stored in Temp, and
then later in the pattern we rematch the value that was assigned.
<p>
<b>Example 4.</b>
For an example of a recursive pattern, let's define a pattern
that is like the built in Bal, but the string matched is balanced
with respect to square brackets or curly brackets.
<p>
The language for such strings might be defined in extended BNF as
<pre>
ELEMENT ::= &lt;any character other than [] or {}&gt;
           | '[' BALANCED_STRING ']'
           | '{' BALANCED_STRING '}'
BALANCED_STRING ::= ELEMENT {ELEMENT}
</pre><p>
Here we use "{}" to indicate zero or more occurrences of a term, as
is common practice in extended BNF. Now we can translate the above
BNF into recursive patterns as follows:
<pre>
Pattern Element = @notany("[]{}") \
                  | ("[" Balanced_String "]") \
                  | ("{" Balanced_String "}")@;
Pattern Balanced_String = @Element arbno(Element)@;

VarMap vars = new VarMap();
vars.put("Balanced_String",Balanced_String);
</pre><p>
Note the important use of + here to refer to a pattern not yet
defined. Note also that we use assignments precisely because we
cannot refer to as yet undeclared variables in initializations.
<p>
Now that this pattern is constructed, we can use it as though it
were a new primitive pattern element. For example, the match:
<pre>
Pattern p = @+Balanced_String*Current_Output fail@;
P.matcher().match("xy[ab{cd}]")
</pre><p>
will generate the output (assuming that <i>Current_Output</i>
has been initialized with an instance of <i>java.util.Collection</i>).
<pre>
x xy xy[ab{cd}] y y[ab{cd}] [ab{cd}] a ab ab{cd} b b{cd} {cd} c cd d
</pre><p>
Note that the function of the fail operator here is simply to force the
pattern Balanced_String to match all possible alternatives. Studying
the operation of this pattern in detail is highly instructive.
<p>
<b>Example 5.</b>
Finally we give a rather elaborate example of the use of deferred
matching and the ExternalFunction mechanism.
The following declarations build up a pattern which will
find the longest string of decimal digits in the subject string.
<pre>
public class Test5b extends Test
{
    GTS gts = new GTS();
...
    public Pattern makePattern()
    {
        vars.put("GTS",gts);
        vars.put("Digit","0123456789");
        Pattern Digs = @span(+Digit)@;
        // Note that the comments are inside the backslash
        Pattern Find = @""*Max fence           // initialize Max to null \
                        & breakx(+Digit)       // scan looking for digits \
                        & ((span(+Digit)*Cur   // assign next string to Cur \
                            & +GTS             // check size(Cur) > Size(Max) \
                            & setcur(+Loc))    // if so, save location \
                           * Max)              // and assign to Max. \
                        & fail@;               // seek all alternatives
        return Find; // top level pattern
    }
}
...
class GTS implements ExternalVariable
{
...
    public Object get(VarMap vars) {
        String Cur = vars.getString("Cur","");
        String Max = vars.getString("Max","");
        return Boolean.valueOf(Cur.length() > Max.length());
    }
    public void put(VarMap vars, Object val) {} // not used
}
</pre><p>
As we see from the comments here, complex patterns like this take
on aspects of sequential programs. In fact they are sequential
programs with general backtracking. In this pattern, we first use
a pattern assignment that matches null and assigns it to Max, so
that it is initialized for the new match. Now BreakX scans to the
next digit. Arb would do here, but BreakX will be more efficient.
Once we have found a digit, we scan out the longest string of
digits with Span, and assign it to Cur. The deferred call to GTS
tests if the string we assigned to Cur is the longest so far. If
not, then failure is signalled, and we seek alternatives (this
means that BreakX will extend and look for the next digit string).
If the call to GTS succeeds then the matched string is assigned
as the largest string so far into Max and its location is saved
in Loc. Finally Fail forces the match to fail and seek alternatives,
so that the entire string is searched.
<p>
If the pattern Find is matched against a string, the variable Max
at the end of the pattern will have the longest string of digits,
and Loc will be the starting character location of the string. For
example, Match("ab123cd4657ef23", Find) will assign "4657" to Max
and 11 to Loc (indicating that Subject.substring(0,11) 
has been matched.
This example is taken from tests/Test5b.pat.
