<h2><u><a name="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></a></u></h2>

Most current programming languages provide some form of
pattern matching. As a rule, the pattern matching is
based on regular expressions. The Comit/Snobol3/Snobol4/Spitbol
programming languages have provided pattern matching but
based on a pattern matching paradigm that is strictly more
powerful than standard regular expressions.
<p>
The goal of this project is to make Snobol4-style pattern matching
available as a package for the Java programming language.
Rather than build such a package from scratch,
Rober Dewar's
existing
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.3.6/gnat_rm/The-GNAT-Library.html#The-GNAT-Library">Ada-based Gnat Spitbol Patterns code</a>
was converted to Java.
The result is generally consistent with that Ada package, although
some changes were made to conform to the capabilities and
limitations of the Java language. In light of the derived nature of this code,
the original GNAT license is assumed to cover this code.
The compiler, however is licensed under a BSD license.
See the <a target="_self" href="#License">License Section</a>
for more details.

<h2><u><a name="Status"><b>Status</b></a></u></h2>
This software should be considered to be in late Alpha stage.
Testing has been spotty at best.
While the author is not currently using this software,
he is supporting it, and bug fixes and extensions are welcome.

<h2><a name="Download"><b>Download</b></a></h2>
Refer to 
<a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~dennis/software">
http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~dennis/software
for download information.
<p>
In addition, earlier versions may also be available through that page.
<p>
Note that the <code>jpattern-x.x.jar</code> file is not itself executable
by java. It must be downloaded and extracted. An executable jar file
(also named <i>jpattern.jar</i>)
is included in the set of extracted files.
<p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li> Java -- This interpreter uses features of Java 1.5.
</ul>

<h2><u><a name="Installation"><b>Installation</b></a></u></h2>
The distribution contains both an ant build.xml file
and a Makefile. Both have the following major tasks defined.
<ul>
<li><i>all</i>: Compile the source and construct the jar file
called <code>jpattern.jar</code>.
It is assumed that the JDK 1.5 bin directory
is in the PATH environment variable.
<p><li><i>clean</i>: Delete the .class files, the jar file,
and the manifest file.
</ul>
The final product is the jar file called <code>jpattern.jar</code>.
For convenience, a version of that jar file is included. It has been
compiled with jdk1.5.

<h2><u><a name="Testing"><b>Testing</b></a></u></h2>
<p>
A set of tests is provided in the directory name <code>tests</code>.
A make Makefile and an ant build.xml file are both provided.
<p>
The output of the tests is captured and compared to the expected output.
Any discrepancies are reported. 
<p>
The set of tests is rather sketchy; it is derived from various examples
from online, from the snobol4 book, and from bug reports. If anyone knows
of a more comprehensive set of pattern tests, please contact the
<a target="_self" href="#Point of Contact">author</a>.

<h2><u><a name="Compiler">The JPattern Pseudo-Compiler</a></u></h2>
The package jpattern.compiler supports the
compilation of string expressions into equivalent Pattern
objects.
It is capable of converting a string representation of a pattern
to equivalent Java code (via a command line interface)
or
to a Pattern object at runtime (via an API).
Refer to the reference manual for more details.

<hr><hr> <h2><a name="Changes"><b>Change Log</b></a></h2>

<h2><a name="changesv1"><b>Changes Incorporated into Version 1</b></a></h2>
<p>
Minor version levels are indicated in parentheses.
<ul>
<li> (0) This is the initial release
<p>
<li> (1) Modified the licensing to conform to Robert Dewar's request.
<li> (1) Changed the -java flag to be -tag.
<li> (1) Added  the -xmltag flag.
<p>
<li> (2) Added a manifest to jpattern.jar so it can be used in compiler mode.
<li> (2) Modified the distribution to include a pre-compiled jpattern.jar.
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="changesv2"><b>Changes Incorporated into Version 2</b></a></h2>
<p>
Minor version levels are indicated in parentheses.
<ul>
<li> (0) Fixed a number of foolish errors, some introduced in version 1.2
(Thanks to Arjan Loeffen of Valid/Vision.). These include:
	<ul>
	<li> The pattern fence(arb &amp; "b") &amp; "c"
		matched against subject "b" throws
		java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -2147483647 , while
		fence(arb &amp; "b") doesn't. 
	<li> The pattern len(1) fails on subject "a".
	<li> The pattern "a" ** MATCH on subject "a"
	     throws java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -2147483647.
	<li> The pattern bal("()") doesn't seem to work, while bal does.
	</ul>
<li> (0) Modified the test set files to all extend Test.java to handle
         the common code.
<li> (0) Did some significant refactoring.
<li> (0) Fixed errors in ParseArgs.java that did not handle missing
         arguments correctly.
<li> (0) Added backquote strings to pass through Java expressions
         for use during pattern construction.
<li> (0) Replaced the Function mechanism with a somewhat more general
         ExternalVariable mechanism.
<li> (0) Added an ExternalPattern mechanism to support user defined
         pattern objects in matching.
<li> (0) Divided doc/jpattern.html into jpattern.html and refman.html.
<li> (0) The structure of the classes and their use has been
         modified to look more like the java.util.regex structure.
<li> (0) The test cases have been moved from package <i>jpattern.test</i>
         to <i>test</i> so that they do not have implicit access
         to the jpattern package, thus being able to expose access errors.
</ul>
