This document describes the basic operation of the pattern
matching operators.  It is a modification of the original
Ada code description.  The modifications correct some errors
and reflect the operation of the Java version.

<h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
<p>
A pattern structure is represented as a linked graph of nodes
with the following structure:
<pre>
+------------------------------------+
I                Pcode               I
+------------------------------------+
I                Index               I
+------------------------------------+
I                Pthen               I
+------------------------------------+
I             parameter(s)           I
+------------------------------------+
</pre></center><p>
Pcode is a code value indicating the type of the patterm node. This
code is used both as the discriminant value for the record, and as
the case index in the main match routine that branches to the proper
match code for the given element.
<p>
Index is a serial index number. The use of these serial index
numbers is described in a separate section.
<p>
Pthen is a pointer to the successor node, i.e the node to be matched
if the attempt to match the node succeeds. If this is the last node
of the pattern to be matched, then Pthen points to a dummy node
of kind PC_EOP (end of pattern), which initiales pattern exit.
<p>
The parameter or parameters are present for certain node types,
and the type varies with the pattern code.
<h3>The Pattern History Stack</h3>
<p>
The pattern history stack is used for controlling backtracking when
a match fails. The idea is to stack entries that give a cursor value
to be restored, and a node to be reestablished as the current node to
attempt an appropriate rematch operation. The processing for a pattern
element that has rematch alternatives pushes an appropriate entry or
entry on to the stack, and the proceeds. If a match fails at any point,
the top element of the stack is popped off, resetting the cursor and
the match continues by accessing the node stored with this entry.
<p>
<h3>The Cursor</h3>
The saved cursor value that is restored when this entry is popped
from the stack if a match attempt fails. Occasionally, this
field is used to store a history stack pointer instead of a
cursor. Such cases are noted in the documentation and the value
stored is negative since stack pointer values are always negative.

<h3>Node</h3>
This pattern element reference is reestablished as the current
Node to be matched (which will attempt an appropriate rematch).
<p>
Note: the pattern matching stack is used only to handle backtracking.
If no backtracking occurs, its entries are never accessed, and never
popped off, and in particular it is normal for a successful match
to terminate with entries on the stack that are simply discarded.
<p>
Note: in subsequent diagrams of the stack, we always place element
vzero (the deepest element) at the top of the page, then build the
stack down on the page with the most recent (top of stack) element
being the bottom-most entry on the page.

<h3>Recursive Pattern Matches</h3>
<p>
The pattern primitive (+P) where P is a Pattern_Ptr or Pattern_Func
causes a recursive pattern match. This cannot be handled by an actual
recursive call to the outer level Match routine, since this would not
allow for possible backtracking into the region matched by the inner
pattern. Indeed this is the classical clash between recursion and
backtracking, and a simple recursive stack structure does not suffice.
<p>
This section describes how this recursion and the possible associated
backtracking is handled. We still use a single stack, but we establish
the concept of nested regions on this stack, each of which has a stack
base value pointing to the deepest stack entry of the region. The base
value for the outer level is zero.
<p>
When a recursive match is established, two special stack entries are
made. The first entry is used to save the original node that starts
the recursive match. This is saved so that the successor field of
this node is accessible at the end of the match, but it is never
popped and executed.
<p>
The second entry corresponds to a standard new region action. A
PC_R_Remove node is stacked, whose cursor field is used to store
the outer stack base, and the stack base is reset to point to
this PC_R_Remove node. Then the recursive pattern is matched and
it can make history stack entries in the normal matter, so now
the stack looks like:
<pre>
(stack entries made by outer level)

(Special entry, node is (+P) successor
cursor entry is not used)

(PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)     <-- Stack base
saved base value for the enclosing region)

(stack entries made by inner level)
</pre></center><p>
If a subsequent failure occurs and pops the PC_R_Remove node, it
removes itself and the special entry immediately underneath it,
restores the stack base value for the enclosing region, and then
again signals failure to look for alternatives that were stacked
before the recursion was initiated.
<p>
Now we need to consider what happens if the inner pattern succeeds, as
signalled by accessing the special PC_EOP pattern primitive. First we
recognize the nested case by looking at the Base value. If this Base
value is Stack'First, then the entire match has succeeded, but if the
base value is greater than Stack'First, then we have successfully
matched an inner pattern, and processing continues at the outer level.
<p>
There are two cases. The simple case is when the inner pattern has made
no stack entries, as recognized by the fact that the current stack
pointer is equal to the current base value. In this case it is fine to
remove all trace of the recursion by restoring the outer base value and
using the special entry to find the appropriate successor node.
<p>
The more complex case arises when the inner match does make stack
entries. In this case, the PC_EOP processing stacks a special entry
whose cursor value saves the saved inner base value (the one that
references the corresponding PC_R_Remove value), and whose node
pointer references a PC_R_Restore node, so the stack looks like:
<pre>
(stack entries made by outer level)

(Special entry, node is (+P) successor,
cursor entry is not used)

(PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
saved base value for the enclosing region)

(stack entries made by inner level)

(PC_Region_Replace entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
stack pointer value referencing the PC_R_Remove entry).
</pre></center><p>
If the entire match succeeds, then these stack entries are, as usual,
ignored and abandoned. If on the other hand a subsequent failure
causes the PC_Region_Replace entry to be popped, it restores the
inner base value from its saved "cursor" value and then fails again.
Note that it is OK that the cursor is temporarily clobbered by this
pop, since the second failure will reestablish a proper cursor value.

<he>Compound Pattern Structures</h3>
<p>
This section discusses the compound structures used to represent
constructed patterns. It shows the graph structures of pattern
elements that are constructed, and in the case of patterns that
provide backtracking possibilities, describes how the history
stack is used to control the backtracking. Finally, it notes the
way in which the Index numbers are assigned to the structure.
<p>
In all diagrams, solid lines (built witth minus signs or vertical
bars, represent successor pointers (Pthen fields) with > or V used
to indicate the direction of the pointer. The initial node of the
structure is in the upper left of the diagram. A dotted line is an
alternative pointer from the element above it to the element below
it. See individual sections for details on how alternatives are used.

<h4>Concatenation</h4>
In the pattern structures listed in this section, a line that looks
lile '---->' with nothing to the right indicates an end of pattern
(EOP) pointer that represents the end of the match.
<p>
When a pattern concatenation (L &amp; R) occurs, the resulting structure
is obtained by finding all such EOP pointers in L, and replacing
them to point to R. This is the most important flattening that
occurs in constructing a pattern, and it means that the pattern
matching circuitry does not have to keep track of the structure
of a pattern with respect to concatenation, since the appropriate
succesor is always at hand.
<p>
Concatenation itself generates no additional possibilities for
backtracking, but the constituent patterns of the concatenated
structure will make stack entries as usual. The maximum amount
of stack required by the structure is thus simply the sum of the
maximums required by L and R.

<h4>Alternation</h4>
<p>
A pattern (L or R) constructs the structure:
<pre>
+---+     +---+
| A |---->| L |---->
+---+     +---+
.
.
+---+
| R |---->
+---+
</pre><p>
The A element here is a PC_Alt node, and the dotted line represents
the contents of the Alt field. When the PC_Alt element is matched,
it stacks a pointer to the leading element of R on the history stack
so that on subsequent failure, a match of R is attempted.
<p>
The A node is the higest numbered element in the pattern. The
original index numbers of R are unchanged, but the index numbers
of the L pattern are adjusted up by the count of elements in R.
<p>
Note that the difference between the index of the L leading element
the index of the R leading element (after building the alt structure)
indicates the number of nodes in L, and this is true even after the
structure is incorporated into some larger structure. For example,
if the A node has index 16, and L has index 15 and R has index
5, then we know that L has 10 (15-5) elements in it.
<p>
Suppose that we now concatenate this structure to another pattern
with 9 elements in it. We will now have the A node with an index
of 25, L with an index of 24 and R with an index of 14. We still
know that L has 10 (24-14) elements in it, numbered 15-24, and
consequently the successor of the alternation structure has an
index with a value less than 15. This is used in Image to figure
out the original recursive structure of a pattern.
<p>
To clarify the interaction of the alternation and concatenation
structures, here is a more complex example of the structure built
for the pattern:
<p>
(V or W or X) (Y or Z)
<p>
where A,B,C,D,E are all single element patterns:
<pre>
+---+     +---+       +---+     +---+
I A I---->I V I---+-->I A I---->I Y I---->
+---+     +---+   I   +---+     +---+
.               I     .
.               I     .
+---+     +---+   I   +---+
I A I---->I W I-->I   I Z I---->
+---+     +---+   I   +---+
.               I
.               I
+---+             I
I X I------------>+
+---+
</pre><p>
The numbering of the nodes would be as follows:
<p>
+---+     +---+       +---+     +---+
I 8 I---->I 7 I---+-->I 3 I---->I 2 I---->
+---+     +---+   I   +---+     +---+
.               I     .
.               I     .
+---+     +---+   I   +---+
I 6 I---->I 5 I-->I   I 1 I---->
+---+     +---+   I   +---+
.               I
.               I
+---+             I
I 4 I------------>+
+---+
<p>
Note: The above structure actually corresponds to
<p>
(A or (B or C)) (D or E)
<p>
rather than
<p>
((A or B) or C) (D or E)
<p>
which is the more natural interpretation, but in fact alternation
is associative, and the construction of an alternative changes the
left grouped pattern to the right grouped pattern in any case, so
that the Image function produces a more natural looking output.

<p>
<h3>Patterns</h3>
<p>
In the pattern structures listed in this section, a line that looks
lile ----> with nothing to the right indicates an end of pattern
(EOP) pointer that represents the end of the match.

<h3><a name="Alternation">Alternation/Or/'|'</a></h3>
<p>
If the left pattern is null, then we just add the alternation
node with an index one greater than the right hand pattern.
if the left pattern is non-null, then build a reference vector
for its elements, and adjust their index values to acccomodate
the right hand elements. Then add the alternation node.
<h3><a name="Any">Any</a></h3>

<p>
An Arb pattern builds the structure
<pre>

.
.
+---+
| Y |---->
+---+
</pre><p>

<h3><a name="Arbno">Arbno</a></h3>
<p>
<h4>Simple Case</h4>
<p>
The simple form of Arbno can be used where the pattern always
matches at least one character if it succeeds, and it is known
not to make any history stack entries. In this case, Arbno (P)
can construct the following structure:
<pre>
+-------------+
|             ^
V             |
+---+           |
| S |---->      |
+---+           |
.             |
.             |
+---+           |
| P |---------->+
+---+
</pre><p>
The S (PC_Arbno_S) node matches null stacking a pointer to the
pattern P. If a subsequent failure causes P to be matched and
this match succeeds, then node A gets restacked to try another
instance if needed by a subsequent failure.

<h4>Complex Case</h4>
<p>
This is the complex case, either the pattern makes stack entries
or it is possible for the pattern to match the null string(more
accurately, we don't know that this is not the case).
<pre>
+--------------------------+
|                          ^
V                          |
+---+                        |
| X |---->                   |
+---+                        |
.                          |
.                          |
+---+     +---+     +---+    |
| E |---->| P |---->| Y |--->+
+---+     +---+     +---+
</pre><p>
The node X (PC_Arbno_X) matches null, stacking a pointer to the
E-P-X structure used to match one Arbno instance.
<p>
Here E is the PC_R_Enter node which matches null and creates two
stack entries. The first is a special entry whose node field is
not used at all, and whose cursor field has the initial cursor.
<p>
The second entry corresponds to a standard new region action. A
PC_R_Remove node is stacked, whose cursor field is used to store
the outer stack base, and the stack base is reset to point to
this PC_R_Remove node. Then the pattern P is matched, and it can
make history stack entries in the normal manner, so now the stack
looks like:
<pre>
(stack entries made before assign pattern)

(Special entry, node field not used,
used only to save initial cursor)

(PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)  <-- Stack Base
saved base value for the enclosing region)

(stack entries made by matching P)
</pre><p>
If the match of P fails, then the PC_R_Remove entry is popped and
it removes both itself and the special entry underneath it,
restores the outer stack base, and signals failure.
<p>
If the match of P succeeds, then node Y, the PC_Arbno_Y node, pops
the inner region. There are two possibilities. If matching P left
no stack entries, then all traces of the inner region can be removed.
If there are stack entries, then we push an PC_Region_Replace stack
entry whose "cursor" value is the inner stack base value, and then
restore the outer stack base value, so the stack looks like:
<pre>
(stack entries made before assign pattern)

(Special entry, node field not used,
used only to save initial cursor)

(PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
saved base value for the enclosing region)

(stack entries made by matching P)

(PC_Region_Replace entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
stack pointer value referencing the PC_R_Remove entry).
</pre><p>
Now that we have matched another instance of the Arbno pattern,
we need to move to the successor. There are two cases. If the
Arbno pattern matched null, then there is no point in seeking
alternatives, since we would just match a whole bunch of nulls.
In this case we look through the alternative node, and move
directly to its successor (i.e. the successor of the Arbno
pattern). If on the other hand a non-null string was matched,
we simply follow the successor to the alternative node, which
sets up for another possible match of the Arbno pattern.
<p>
As noted in the section on stack checking, the stack count (and
hence the stack check) for a pattern includes only one iteration
of the Arbno pattern. To make sure that multiple iterations do not
overflow the stack, the Arbno node saves the stack count required
by a single iteration, and the Concat function increments this to
include stack entries required by any successor. The PC_Arbno_Y
node uses this count to ensure that sufficient stack remains
before proceeding after matching each new instance.

<h3><a name="Assign">Assign/'.'/'*'</a></h3>
The assign on match (**) pattern is quite similar to the
<a target="_self" href="#IAssign">assign immediate</a>
pattern, except that the actual assignment has to be
delayed. The following structure is constructed:
<pre>
    +---+     +---+     +---+
    | E |---->| P |---->| A |---->
    +---+     +---+     +---+
</pre><p>
The operation of this pattern is identical to that described above
for deferred assignment, up to the point where P has been matched.
<p>
The A node, which is the PC_Assign_OnM node first pushes a
PC_Assign node onto the history stack. This node saves the ending
cursor and acts as a flag for the final assignment, as further
described below.
<p>
It then stores a pointer to itself in the special entry node field.
This was otherwise unused, and is now used to retrive the address
of the variable to be assigned at the end of the pattern.
<p>
After that the inner region is terminated in the usual manner,
by stacking a PC_R_Restore entry as described for the assign
immediate case. Note that the optimization of completely
removing the inner region does not happen in this case, since
we have at least one stack entry (the PC_Assign one we just made).
The stack now looks like:
<pre>
     (stack entries made before assign pattern)

     (Special entry, node points to copy of
      the PC_Assign_OnM node, and the
      cursor field saves the initial cursor).

     (PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
      saved base value for the enclosing region)

     (stack entries made by matching P)

     (PC_Assign entry, saves final cursor)

     (PC_Region_Replace entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
      stack pointer value referencing the PC_R_Remove entry).
</pre><p>
If a subsequent failure causes the PC_Assign node to execute it
simply removes itself and propagates the failure.
<p>
If the match succeeds, then the history stack is scanned for
PC_Assign nodes, and the assignments are executed (examination
of the above diagram will show that all the necessary data is
at hand for the assignment).
<p>
To optimize the common case where no assign-on-match operations
are present, a global flag Assign_OnM is maintained which is
initialize to False, and gets set True as part of the execution
of the PC_Assign_OnM node. The scan of the history stack for
PC_Assign entries is done only if this flag is set.

<h3><a name="Concatentation"</a>Concatentation/'&amp;'</h3>
<p>
When a pattern concatenation (L &amp; R) occurs, the resulting structure
is obtained by finding all such EOP pointers in L, and replacing
them to point to R. This is the most important flattening that
occurs in constructing a pattern, and it means that the pattern
matching circuitry does not have to keep track of the structure
of a pattern with respect to concatenation, since the appropriate
succesor is always at hand.
<p>
Concatenation itself generates no additional possibilities for
backtracking, but the constituent patterns of the concatenated
structure will make stack entries as usual. The maximum amount
of stack required by the structure is thus simply the sum of the
maximums required by L and R.
<p>
The index numbering of a concatenation structure works by leaving
the numbering of the right hand pattern, R, unchanged and adjusting
the numbers in the left hand pattern, L up by the count of elements
in R. This ensures that the maximum numbered element is the leading
element as required (given that it was the leading element in L).

The node numbering of the constituent pattern P is not affected.
Where N is the number of nodes in P, the X node is numbered N + 1,
and the E node is N + 2.

<h3><a name="IAssign">Assign Immediate/'$'/'**'</a></h3>
Immediate assignment (P > V) constructs the following structure

    +---+     +---+     +---+
</pre><p>
Here E is the PC_R_Enter node which matches null and creates two
stack entries. The first is a special entry whose node field is
not used at all, and whose cursor field has the initial cursor.
<p>
The second entry corresponds to a standard new region action. A
PC_R_Remove node is stacked, whose cursor field is used to store
the outer stack base, and the stack base is reset to point to
this PC_R_Remove node. Then the pattern P is matched, and it can
make history stack entries in the normal manner, so now the stack
looks like:
<pre>
     (stack entries made before assign pattern)

     (Special entry, node field not used,

     (PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)  <-- Stack Base
      saved base value for the enclosing region)

     (stack entries made by matching P)
</pre><p>
If the match of P fails, then the PC_R_Remove entry is popped
and it removes both itself and the special entry underneath it,
restores the outer stack base, and signals failure.
<p>
If the match of P succeeds, then node A, which is the actual
PC_Assign_Imm node, executes the assignment (using the stack
base to locate the entry with the saved starting cursor value),
and the pops the inner region. There are two possibilities, if
matching P left no stack entries, then all traces of the inner
region can be removed. If there are stack entries, then we push
an PC_Region_Replace stack entry whose "cursor" value is the
inner stack base value, and then restore the outer stack base
value, so the stack looks like:
<pre>
     (stack entries made before assign pattern)

     (Special entry, node field not used,
      used only to save initial cursor)

     (PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
      saved base value for the enclosing region)

     (stack entries made by matching P)

     (PC_Region_Replace entry, "cursor" value is the (negative)
      stack pointer value referencing the PC_R_Remove entry).
</pre><p>
If a subsequent failure occurs, the PC_Region_Replace node restores
the inner stack base value and signals failure to explore rematches
of the pattern P.

<h3><a name="Bal">Bal</a></h3>
<pr>
Bal builds a single node:
<pre>
    +---+
    | B |---->
    +---+
</pre><p>
The node B is the PC_Bal node which matches a parentheses balanced
string, starting at the current cursor position. It then updates
the cursor past this matched string, and stacks a pointer to itself
with this updated cursor value on the history stack, to extend the
matched string on a subequent failure.

<h3><a name="BreakX">BreakX</a></h3>
<p>
BreakX builds the structure
<pre>

      |       +---+
      +<------| X |
              +---+
</pre><p>
Here the B node is the BreakX_xx node that performs a normal Break
function. The A node is an alternative (PC_Alt) node that matches
null, but stacks a pointer to node X (the PC_BreakX_X node) which
extends the match one character (to eat up the previously detected
break character), and then rematches the break.

The element F, PC_Fence,  matches null, and stacks a pointer to a
PC_Cancel element which will abort the match on a subsequent failure.

<h3><a name="FenceFunction">Fence Function</a></h3>
<p>
A call to the Fence function builds the structure:
<pre>
    +---+     +---+     +---+
    | E |---->| P |---->| X |---->
    +---+     +---+     +---+
</pre><p>
Here E is the PC_R_Enter node which matches null and creates two
stack entries. The first is a special entry which is not used at
all in the fence case (it is present merely for uniformity with
other cases of region enter operations).
<p>
The second entry corresponds to a standard new region action. A
PC_R_Remove node is stacked, whose cursor field is used to store
the outer stack base, and the stack base is reset to point to
this PC_R_Remove node. Then the pattern P is matched, and it can
make history stack entries in the normal manner, so now the stack
looks like:
<pre>
     (stack entries made before assign pattern)

     (Special entry, not used at all)

     (PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)  <-- Stack Base
      saved base value for the enclosing region)

     (stack entries made by matching P)
</pre><p>
If the match of P fails, then the PC_R_Remove entry is popped
and it removes both itself and the special entry underneath it,
restores the outer stack base, and signals failure.
<p>
If the match of P succeeds, then node X, the PC_Fence_X node, gets
control. One might be tempted to think that at this point, the
history stack entries made by matching P can just be removed since
they certainly are not going to be used for rematching (that is
whole point of Fence after all!) However, this is wrong, because
it would result in the loss of possible assign-on-match entries
for deferred pattern assignments.
<p>
Instead what we do is to make a special entry whose node references
PC_Fence_Y, and whose cursor saves the inner stack base value, i.e.
the pointer to the PC_R_Remove entry. Then the outer stack base
pointer is restored, so the stack looks like:
<pre>
     (stack entries made before assign pattern)

     (Special entry, not used at all)

     (PC_R_Remove entry, "cursor" value is (negative)
      saved base value for the enclosing region)

     (stack entries made by matching P)

     (PC_Fence_Y entry, "cursor" value is (negative) stack
      pointer value referencing the PC_R_Remove entry).
</pre><p>
If a subsequent failure occurs, then the PC_Fence_Y entry removes
the entire inner region, including all entries made by matching P,
and alternatives prior to the Fence pattern are sought.

Static Constant Patterns
This is the end of pattern element, and is thus the representation of
a null pattern. It has a zero index element since it is never placed
inside a pattern. Furthermore it does not need a successor, since it
marks the end of the pattern, so that no more successors are needed.
Note: this is the only case where Pthen == null
